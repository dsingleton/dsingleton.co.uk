Examples of Markdown elements and how they're styled.

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line. Excerpts are picked at the first double blank line.

Real posts are still the best examples of combinations of elements like [text heavy content ](/blog/virtualised-development-environments/), [sets of images](/blog/facebook-photo-facial-recognition/), [text mixed with code and video](/blog/erlang-beginners-tutorial/) or [lists and headings](/blog/software-that-i-use/).

in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.

Unicode ✔︎ and Emoji ✅ are supported

> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
