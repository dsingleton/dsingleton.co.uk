        <h1>@media London 2007</h1>
        <p>My first <strong>@media</strong> and it was a lot of fun.</p>
<h3>Preperation</h3>
<p>Wednesday evening started with boxes, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/541187069/"><em>lots</em> of boxes</a> which contained <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/541078840/">@media bags</a> to be stuffed, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/541078158/"><strong>lots</strong> of bags</a>. Job done we wandered down to the pub in time for a few pre-event drinks and to show off our dashing orange shirts.</p>

<h3>Day One</h3>
<p>Unfortunately I missed most of <strong>Jesse James Garrett’s</strong> opening session and some interesting bits of <strong>Jason Santa Maria</strong>, including taking colour palettes from photographs and nature. The first real session of the day for me was the High-Noon Shoot-Out between <strong>Drew McLellan</strong> and <strong>Simon Collison</strong>, I think Drew won, but he did come <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/541184861/">prepared with props</a>.</p>
<p>Lunch followed, as did some excellent talks from <strong>Dan Cederholm</strong> and <strong>Mark Boulton</strong>. I’d seen mark speak quite briefly before at <span class="caps">SXSW</span>, but hearing a ‘full set’ was great. <strong>Joe Clark</strong> ended the day with the alarmist “<em>When Web Accessibility Is Not Your Problem</em>” – it was certainly interesting and made sense, but felt a bit odd to me.</p>

<h3>The Party</h3>
<p>Clockwerk was heaving! When we arrived the queue for the bar was to the door. Gradually people realized there was a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/541075502/">bar upstairs</a> as well ad the rush subsided. I was impressed how long the free bar lasted, considering some events I’ve been to where thirsty geeks will exhaust it in minutes.</p>
<p>It was nice to do some socialising with those I knew and those I didn’t. It was also nice to see a bunch of the <a href="http://last.fm/">Last.fm</a> guys there and have some people (who i’d yet to tell) congratulate me on my new job there.</p>
<h3>Day Two</h3>
<p>Friday started with <strong>John Hicks’</strong> with a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/541181739/">talk on creatively</a> for non-designers, what I caught was interesting. Next up was a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/541179735/">split session</a> between <strong>Hannah Donovan</strong> and <strong>Simon Willison</strong> talking about <a href="http://last.fm/">Last.fm</a> and <a href="http://lawrence.com/">lawrence.com</a> respectively. Discussing actual <em>real world</em> sites, rather than fairly vague theory, this session was by far the highlight of the event for me.</p>

<p>Before lunch I saw <strong>Håkon Wium Lie</strong>, one of the creators of <span class="caps">CSS</span>, discussing browsers, the $100 laptop and some of the more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/541178703/">tantalising aspects of <span class="caps">CSS3</span></a>. Afterwards <strong>Dan Webb</strong> did his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/541178703/">Javascript Kung Fu</a>, very interesting – even if he does prefer Prototype to jQuery.</p>
<p>The day closed with the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/541068870/">hot topics panel</a> of; <strong>Richard Ishida</strong>, <strong>Dan Cederholm</strong>, <strong>Jeremy Keith</strong>, <strong>Joe Clark</strong> and the internet’s <strong>Drew McLellan</strong>. I was actually quite disappointed by the panel, for various reasons, but mainly for the fact half the time was spent ‘discussing’ various <span class="caps">W3C</span>-isn’t-working issues. Important as they may be the whole thing felt agendered and not very fun, which was a shame with the interesting lineup of panelists.</p>

<p>With everything wrapped up I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/541067932/">finished my tea</a> and we all wandered down to the pub again, lovely.
