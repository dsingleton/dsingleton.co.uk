        <h1>Going public (again)</h1>
        <p>I started using Twitter a couple of years ago, following the buzz of SXSW &#8216;07. I started out, as almost everyone did, with my statuses open to everyone. There seemed no reason to be private with my status updates. Twitter was a (relatively) new and tiny service, known only to power-geek types so privacy concerns didn&#8217;t really enter in to it.</p>
<p>As I used Twitter more, and Twitter itself became more popular, my updates became more candid - in both opinion and personal information. That&#8217;s a good thing, Twitter thrives on open and honest messages. However, around the same time I got a lot more concerned about privacy. There was a variety of reasons behind this, but a big factor was dealing with a handful of&#8230; unhappy and not very nice users. Suffice to say the internet is a very serious business to some people, and this shifted my mindset from the hypothetical to a more literal.</p>
<p>I switched my updates to private and was pretty happy with this for some time. But over time the decision irked me, I still feel private updates go against the &#8220;spirit&#8221; of Twitter. It also caused some technical annoyances, simple things like using search.twitter.com is broken if you&#8217;re searching your own private updates. It makes API/feed access all the more difficult too.</p>
<p>Tonight I switched my status updates back to public. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;ll stay like that permanently, but we&#8217;ll see. While thinking about that decision I thought about my reasons for going private in the first place;</p>
<ol><li>Opinions - I tend to be pretty forthright about things I don&#8217;t like. With the internet every becoming a permanent archive of everything how would future employers feel about crass heat-of-the-moment comments? The solution here? A little restraint on my part, which all things considered is probably a good thing anyway.</li>
<li>Personal Information - &#8220;I&#8217;m in place X, doing thing Y!&#8221;. This one&#8217;s trickier, after all, one of the best things about Twitter is someone else responding &#8220;Me too&#8221;. But they shouldn&#8217;t have to be following me for that to work. Two solutions here, share less -or- stop caring. I think i&#8217;ve ended up somewhere in the middle. </li>
</ol><p>So that about brings things full circle. In an ideal world there&#8217;s a halfway solution between walled-garden privacy and 100% publicness, but for now the technology just isn&#8217;t there and i&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s exactly what people want.</p>
