        <h1>Dconstruct 2006</h1>
        <p>I’ve been back from Brighton for almost 24 hours now and I’ve just about caught up on sleep. It was a blast.</p>


<h3>Thursday Night</h3>

<p>The pre-event part  at <a href="http://www.citikey.com/business/10157110/category/30016/city/Brighton/current/9/total/26">Heist</a> was     good fun, meeting and talking with people I’ve met before at London     events and some new ones. Unfortunately I don’t think the planned salsa     lessons organized by <a href="http://www.adamandjude.com/">Adam</a> ever     materialized!</p>
<p>After being kicked out around 12:30 a rather large group headed     towards Brighton sea front to keep drinking. Only half a dozen made it     that far and after Patrick Griffiths tried     to convince us to go to the ‘Honey Club’ we ended up going back to the     hotel for a relatively early night.</p>
<h3>The Event Itself</h3>
<p>The next morning registration was very quick and easy, we also got presented     with goody bags including BBC backstage t shirts, a copy of .net, Creative     Commons badges and the usual array of pens, stickers and such.</p>
<p>I won’t go into details of the presentations (As I plan to (h)review them later),     but I particularly enjoyed <a href="htp://adactio.com/">Jeremy’s</a> Joy and <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">Simon</a>/<a href="http://www.paulhammond.org/">Paul </a>explaining how API’s have benefited Yahoo internally.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me throughout the days presentation was the emphasis     on the open data APIs and Web Services can provide, licensing and just how     open some data should be. A few speakers struck on this briefly, notably <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/">Aral     Balkan</a> mentioning postcode/geo-coding in the UK, but it really needs more discussion.</p>
<h3>Micoformats</h3>
<p>Although I’ve not been vocally active around <a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a> on     my <a href="http://dsingleton.co.uk/">blog</a> I     have following the project     and quietly adding hCard and XFN data where I can. So It was great to see     a big turn out for the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/upcoming:event=104699">Microformats</a> picnic.     <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/thevoicewithin/238544560/">Jeremy     Keith </a> preached     to the assembled mass of geeks, plus a small group of confused locals (who     I heard told thought it was a scientology meeting).</p>

<h3>Friday Evening</h3>
<p>After the final presentation everyone slowly migrated towards the after for     food, drink and golf. After a quick meal a group of us pottered down to the Geek Golf tournament, although the results aren’t all in  I <em>think</em> managed     to play a winning round, months of pitch and put practice on Portsmouth seafront     might have paid of after all.</p>
<p>Back to the party and I got to chat with a     lot of people from all over     the country exchanging stories, jokes, drinks and web 2.0-base crime ideas.     I especially enjoyed talking to <a href="http://iamrice.org/">Damien         Tanner</a> about a XFN-powered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">Six             Degrees of <del>Separation</del></a> Jeffery Zeldman, which I hope he still             plans to work on.</p>
<p>As people began to leave, catching last trains or driving home, a group of     us walked along to <a href="http://www.travelintelligence.net/wsd/hotels/htls_2259_Blanch_House_Brighton_review.html">Blanch     House</a> for cocktails and more banter and drunkenness. A special thanks     to Frances for giving me a spare bed to sleep on that night and introducing     me to some very interesting/nice people.</p>

<p>About 3am I     wandered through the streets of Brighton to the hotel with Patrick and Frances,     discussing (amongst other things) atheism, nihilism and existentialism in     the lobby until 4 am. A topic that’s sure to be picked up again at the coming     <a href="http://www.pubstandards.co.uk/">Pub Standards</a>.</p>
<h3>Saturday</h3>
<p>The morning didn’t start for me until a coffee on Brighton pier at midday,     <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/phae_/239220809/in/set-72157594277473625/">getting</a> quite <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/phae_/239220769/in/set-72157594277473625/">wet</a> probably     help woke me up too. Frances and I met up with those who were left, Andy,     Jeremy, Simon, Natalie, Norm, Derek (and others), for lunch and a wander     along the beach.</p>
<p>The highlights included watching Simon Willison and Natalie     Downe <q>Try The Thrilling Bungy Trampoline (Only £5!)</q> (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/phae_/239221738/">photos</a>)     and finding a cheap second hand copy of Douglas Coupland’s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0349108390">Generation     X</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>I absolutely loved dconstruct 2006. Well organised, engaging and informative     speakers, goodie-bags, booze and of course all of the fun of the sea side.</p>
<p>ClearLeft did an amazing job keeping everything running smoothly and most 	    of all enjoyably. Checkout some of the <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=dconstruct2006&amp;m=tags">photos</a> and <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/dconstruct06">blog     posts</a> by 	    others. </p>
