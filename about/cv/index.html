        <section class="introduction">

            <p>Working with the web for 10+ years, I'm passionate about building great user experiences, doing both front-end and back-end development. Most recently I've focused on front-end engineering, but consider myself a generalist.</p>

            <p>I've worked in small and large teams, building and maintaining sites with audiences of dozens to millions.</p>

                    <a href="https://lumi.do">Lumi</a> &#8211;
                    Lead Front-End Engineer <span class="date">(August 2011 &rarr; Present)</span>
                </h3>
                <p class="byline">A content discover startup, using browser history to generate personalised recommendations.</p>

                <p>As the lead front-end engineer, in a very small team, I'm responsible for technology choices, architectural decisions, day-to-day development and hiring of new developers. The Lumi front-end stack I built included;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong class="skill">HTML5</strong> - History API, LocalStorage, semantic markup</li>
                    <li><strong class="skill">CSS3</strong> - CSS Animations, GPU acceleration for smooth scrolling, and using Chrome timeline prevent jank.</li>
                    <li><strong class="skill">SASS</strong>/<strong class="skill">Compass</strong> - Mixins, conditional IE support, dynamic responsive breakpoints and image-spriting</li>
                    <li><strong class="skill">Javascript</strong> - Small, modular, classes using RequireJS for dependency management</li>
                    <li><strong class="skill">jQuery</strong> - Event handling, AJAX, DOM manipulation, plugins</li>
                    <li><strong class="skill">Mustache</strong> - Client side rendering, shared with server-side rendering using Pystache</li>
                    <li><strong class="skill">Grunt</strong> - Automation of JS/CSS minification, re-building assets on local changes, running linting and tests</li>
                </ol>

                <p>I built Lumi using <strong>Progressive Enhancement</strong> and <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong>, often with a <strong>Mobile-First</strong> approach, starting with plain markup, layering on styling and behaviour, and applying RWD (breakpoints and fluid layouts). This allowed us to support many more users without creating platform-specific sites or apps.</p>

                <p>I took a strong interest in client-side security threats; preventing <strong>XSS</strong> and <strong>CSRF</strong>, mitigating click-jacking with <strong>X-Frame-Options</strong>, defending against session highjacking <strong>HttpOnly</strong> and <strong>Secure</strong> cookies.</p>
                

                <p>I use <strong>Python/Django</strong>to build views, <strong>APIs</strong>, internal services, tools and tests. And built a system of templates and JSON data models shared by client and server, maintaining consistent UI for push-state and full-page changes.</p>
                
                <p>I've worked on <strong>Chrome and Firefox extensions</strong>, writing JS to be embedded into 3rd party pages and be extremely defensive to function in hostile contexts and without affecting host pages behaviour.</p>
