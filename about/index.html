    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm a web developer, I wrote code for a living and for fun. I live in East London, also for fun.</p>
    
    <p>I love taking things apart, figuring out how they work, and solving problems. Mostly code or design, but sometimes baking too. Sometimes I write about these things on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>
    
    <p>My day job is web developer at <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a>, a large music social network. I do both front and back end development and have been working with the web for about 10 years now.</p>
    
    <p>I like to visit geek events and gigs in London, so you might meet be at a conference, a hack-day or a barcamp (or just in the pub).</p>
