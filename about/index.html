    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm a web developer, I wrote code for a living and for fun. I live in East London, also for fun.</p>

    <p>I like taking things apart, understanding how they work, and solving problems. Sometimes I write about these things on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>

    <p>My day job is Senior Frontend Developer at the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a>, but I also do full stack development. I've been professionally working on the web for over 10 years.</p>

    <p>I like to visit geek events and gigs in London, so you might meet me at a conference, a hack-day or a barcamp (or at [Pub Standards](https://london.pubstandards.com/)).</p>

    <p>If you like, there are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/davidsingleton/photosof/" rel="me">photos of me</a> on Flickr.</p>

    <h2>Elsewhere online</h2>
    <p>
        I collect <a href="http://del.icio.us/dsingleton/" rel="me">links</a>,
        take <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/" rel="me">photos</a>,
        listen to <a href="http://last.fm/user/underpangs/" rel="me">music</a>,
        attend <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/user/30794/" rel="me">events</a>,
        write <a href="http://github.com/dsingleton" rel="me">code</a>
        and talk <a href="http://twitter.com/dsingleton/" rel="me">nonsense</a>.
    </p>
