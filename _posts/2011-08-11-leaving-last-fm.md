8 years of scrobbling, 55,000 tracks and 4 years with the incredible [Last.fm team](http://www.last.fm/about/team), it’s been a blast, but it’s time to move on and do something new.

It’s been a really difficult decision to leave. Last.fm was quite literally a dream job for me and at times a family. I’m proud to have worked on a brilliant product with so many great people. I feel like i’ve grown up with Last.fm. It’s been, and will always be, a big and very happy part of my life.

I really can’t describe how much I’ve learnt and how much fun i’ve had, but some of highlights include the [ballpit](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/2175975083/), [roof BBQs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/4669213869/), [Nerf wars](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/4417983904/), [big releases](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/2224410166/in/set-72157603403049536), [office music](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/1767603000/in/set-72157603403049536), [stats](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/4112671768/) and [challenges](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/4112671768/), but that’s still just a tiny fraction.

**What next?** Well, a long, and probably wet, weekend camping in Wales. Chilling out a bit and relaxing.
