<p>Finally arrived in Austin, unpacked, had a shower and feel human again.</p>
<p>Frances and I left hammersmith at the <em>ungodly </em>hour of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/414170910/">5am</a>, this is not a real time, it deosn’t exist for normal people.</p>
<p>Met up with Ben, Fatty and Steve at gatwick for breakfast and got ourselves organised for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/414170569/">10 hour flight</a> to Houston.</p>
<p>We got stuck there for a few hours <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/414170444/">due to a delay</a>, but eventually got to austin and to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/414170331/">Hotel</a>.</p>

<p>Austin seems pretty cool, The Hotel is awesome, we overlook the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/414170254/">pool</a> which i’ll have to checkout at some point.</p>
<p>So i’ve arived and i’m alive, more tomorrow. (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/sets/72157594576312233/">Todays photos</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Watching Lost on live TV is a very <em>very</em> odd concept for me.</p>
<p>The fact i’ve been awake for 24 hours now also means i’ve not really clicked that i’m in Texas. Tomorrow i’ll probably start giggling and skipping.</p>
