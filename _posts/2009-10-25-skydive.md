About 3 months ago I jumped out of a plane. From about 14,000 feet. It’s something I’ve wanted to do for years now, and i’m glad I finally did. I’m not sure I’d do it again though.

I raised [just under £350](http://justgiving.com/davidsingletonskydive) for [Macmillan Cancer Support](http://www.justgiving.com/macmillan), thanks to everyone who sponsored me.

A couple of friends are proper skydivers, they helped me organise the jump and even offered to jump with me and film it. Thanks to them you can see the whole thing, especially my face about 37 seconds in, pure terror.
