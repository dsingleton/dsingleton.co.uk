A week later I still haven’t written up my SF trip and as a friend asked for tips here’s a micro version!

> <cite>[@carlgaywood](http://twitter.com/carlgaywood/status/3425639734)</cite> @dsingleton any tips for San Francisco?

**Disclaimer** ;These are mostly based in/around mission as that’s where I stayed.

- [Papalote](http://playfoursquare.com/venue/22250) - Good mexican
- [Thirsty Bear Brewing Company](http://playfoursquare.com/venue/11965) - Local brewery, get the beer sampler
- [Ritual Coffee Roasters](http://playfoursquare.com/venue/19179) - Amazing coffee
- [Dolores Park](http://playfoursquare.com/venue/11833) - Nice to sit in if sunny, amazing views
- [Birite creamery](http://playfoursquare.com/venue/34970) - amazing ice cream shop just near Delores Park
- [Four Barrel Coffee](http://playfoursquare.com/venue/39848) - more excellent coffee

Also trying walking around Delores/Guerrero St area, nice shops including the [pirate store](http://www.826valencia.org/), fun area to explore too.

Get an old fashioned tram to the ferry building, hire a bike a cycle across the golden gate bridge, get the ferry back. Have dinner in down town

I didn’t make this one, but get a bus to the top of twin peaks and look at the amazing all across SF.

Also, here are my photos from the trip;
