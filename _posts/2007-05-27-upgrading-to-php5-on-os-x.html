<p>I’ve been meaning to upgrade <span class="caps">PHP</span> on my macbook for a while now, today I finally got around to it with a little help from <a href="http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/">Marc Liyanage <span class="caps">PHP</span> Package</a>.</p>
<p>Download the installer (~50MB), un-tar and run it. You should not have <span class="caps">PHP5</span> installed on your system. However, you might have to do a bit of fiddling to get it working properly.</p>

<p>These are just the tweaks I needed, you might need to do more or less, but this might be useful in some fashion.</p>
<p>In <em>httpd.conf</em> the <span class="caps">PHP4</span> module was still being loaded, so comment that out and add an entry to load the <span class="caps">PHP5</span> module instead.</p>
<pre><code>#LoadModule php4_module libexec/httpd/libphp4.so
LoadModule php5_module local/php5/libphp5.so</code></pre>
<p>For some reason the PHP5 module was installed at a different path to the oldPHP4 module and all other Apache modules. Rather than move it (and risk other problems) I left it where it was and just used the different path.</p>

<p>Further down <em>httpd.conf</em> there’s another reference to <span class="caps">PHP4</span>, just update the number.</p>
<pre><code>AddModule mod_php5.c</code></pre>
<p>Restart Apache so the changes take effect, with <em>sudo apachectl graceful</em></p>
<p>That should do it.</p>
