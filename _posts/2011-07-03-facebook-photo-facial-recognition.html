<p><em>[These are old, but I&#8217;m clearing my drafts queue]</em></p>

<p>Last Autumn a group of us visited Berlin, renting a bit apartment, exploring the city and taking lots of photos. I don&#8217;t upload photos to Facebook, I&#8217;m more of a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/">Flickr</a> guy, but it was interesting to watch Becky upload hers and compare the process.</p>

<p>The most striking, impressive and creepy difference was that Facebook seem to do facial detection identify faces then try to match them to your friends. I can see why they do it, more tagging = more engagement, but the unintended matching of drawn faces (and more so to real people) is pretty weird.</p>

<p><strong>More detected, but unmatched faces</strong></p>

<p>I wonder how far this effect would stretch? Could Facebook start suffering from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">Pareidolia</a>? </p>
