<p>My good friend <a href="http://markwheeler.net/">Mark Wheeler</a> has been puting together a neat little embeded flash/javasript mp3 player called <a href="http://1bit.markwheeler.net/">1 Bit</a>, which i’ve been writing the Javascript for.</p>

<blockquote><p>1 Bit Audio Player is a very simple and lightweight Adobe Flash MP3 player with automatic JavaScript insertion. It’s main purpose is to act as a quick in-page preview for audio files you link to from your website or blog.</p></blockquote>

<p>It’s prety neat, you can preview mp3s in page, we’ve been using it at <a href="http://www.headhug.net/">Headhug</a>, a friends mp3 blog for a while now. Best of all it’s really easy to get it up and running.</p>

<p>The first version used <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> which caused a few problems, but it’s been re-written from scratch for the latest version. The main aims are to make it unobtrusive, easy to use and to play nicely with other JS libraries. So far, it’s pretty good.</p>

<p>The main version is available from the <a href="http://1bit.markwheeler.net/">official 1Bit site</a>, which has the downloads, documentation. Everything you need to use it on your own site or blog. There’s also the <a href="http://dsingleton.co.uk/code/1bit/">in-development version</a> on my site where i’ve been playing around and trying to improve it, it also has some more demo’s.</p>

<p>So go check out <a href="http://1bit.markwheeler.net/">1 Bit</a>, its nifty.</p>
