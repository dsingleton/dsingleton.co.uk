**Note:** We actually did this a few months ago now – But I lost the ‘making of’ pictures and only found them again recently.

We’ve already got [some art](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/456997932/) up on the walls in our dev room at [work](http://springdigital.co.uk/), but two walls were boring and mostly white.

I decided to take some inspiration from one of my old Uni house-mates, **Mark** , who happens to be a great pixel-artist.

A while back Mark got bored and made [something very neat](http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/29120030/?qo=22&q=by%3Ablackice&qh=boost%3Apopular+-in%3Ascraps) out of a lot of coloured paper and geekyness. “This will look awesome on a big wall” we all agreed.

_So we got started…_

### Time for an Art-Attack

Follow closely and you can recreate your own life size **Pixel Art Space Invaders** at home!

We got a rainbow pack of 3×3” sheets – from staples, or Rymans, or some stationary shop – for a pound or two

[![Step 1: Get Coloured Paper](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/172/471778655_cac75d3b80_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/471778655/ "Step 1: Get Coloured Paper")

We cut down the largish squares of paper in to quarters with a scalpel/metal ruler.

Then mocked up a ship on the desk.

We used copious amounts of blu-tac. You might want to use white-tac as the blue showed through a little bit on the lighter colours.

You also want 3 or 4 people standing and watching whoever is putting the squares up to constantly tell them “_It’s not quite straight!_“

[![Step 3: Attach to wall](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/225/471759476_12427e48d7_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/471759476/ "Step 3: Attach to wall")

This one was a bit difficult to make as the scale version compared to the normal ships is quite a lot bigger – which looked weird on the wall – so we had to shrink it down a bit.

Extra points for the mother ship – shoot where it’s _going_ to be.

[![Step 5: Place bonus ship just out of reach](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/216/471757992_fc0cbe56d5_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/471757992/ "Step 5: Place bonus ship just out of reach")

The final result. Not bad considering it was all done rather spontaneously over lunch one day.

### More Pixels and Space Invaders

There’s been loads of other great pixel/paper art, most of which blows what we did out of the water, but these ones are absolutely amazing and definately deserve a look if you haven’t seen them before.
