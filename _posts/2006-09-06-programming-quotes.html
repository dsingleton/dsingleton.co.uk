<p>I came across a rather impressive list of ‘<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~hottub/software/programming_quotes.html">Programming Quotes</a>‘ today, some humurous, some insightful, some neither, some both.</p>
<p>Definately worth a quickskim through, my favourites:</p>
<blockquote><p>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>Brian W. Kernighan</cite></p>
<blockquote><p>The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time.   The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time.</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>Tom Cargill</cite></p>
<blockquote><p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use  regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>Jamie Zawinski</cite></p>
<blockquote><p>Good code is its own best documentation. As you’re about to add a comment, ask yourself, ‘How can I improve the code so that this comment isn’t needed?’ Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer.</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>Steve McConnell</cite>
