<p>Over the holidays I came discovered Code Golf and got quite addicted to one of the challenges, for those unfamiiar with it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on the original perl golf, Code Golf allows you to show off your code-fu by trying to solve coding problems using the least number of keystrokes.</p>
<p>You’re not just limited to Perl either - PHP, Python and Ruby are all available too.</p>
<p>Challenges are always open, and your entries are automatically scored so you can start playing right away!</p></blockquote>
<p>I spent most of the holidays tweeking and tuning my enrty for the <a title="Code Golf - 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" href="http://codegolf.com/99-bottles-of-beer">99 bottles</a> and managed to get my entry down to <strong>209&#160;</strong>bytes. Far from a winning score, but for my first attempt - and using PHP - i’m quite pleased.</p>

<p>The resulting code is pretty much unreadable, no line breaks, single character variable names - and yes, that kind of code should never rear it’ ugly head in <em>serious </em>project, but its a work out for some of the coding muscles you may not use very often or even at all.</p>
<p>So have a go, try one of the <a title="Code Golf Challanges" href="http://codegolf.com/competition/browse">challenges</a> stretch your brain a bit, or if you’re learning a new language try one of those and get to know some of the dusty corners of the lanuage you’d other wise miss.</p>
<p>More importantly, have a go at 99 Bottles of Beer and tell me how you did.
