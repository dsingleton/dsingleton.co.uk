Last.fm music taste visualised as a London tub-map

[![Taste tube map sample](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2437/3990406530_a349d4ba1e.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/3990406530/ "Taste tube map sample by David Singleton, on Flickr")

View the [full map (PDF)](http://dsingleton.co.uk/static/misc/tube_tags.pdf) covering almost 18 months of my scrobbled listening. I really want to print and wall mount this.

This is from an internal [Last.fm](http://last.fm) visualisation/tech demo. It’s not publicly accessible at the moment, though hopefully it will be at some point soon. If you’re desperate to see yours then poke me on Twitter and I can generate you one.
