<p>Last night I spent 30 minutes having a play with a new (to me) programming language, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">Erlang</a>.</p>

<p>Its a language that will stretch my brain a bit, teach me to think about programming in a different way, and I know some folks using it (Mostly <a href="http://smarkets.com/">Smarkets</a> and <a href="http://irccloud.com">IRCCloud</a>) who&#8217;s brains I can pick in the pub.</p>

<p>These are my quick notes from an Erlang newbie, hopefully useful to someone else getting started who justs wants to install it, write Hello World and go from there.</p>

<h3>Installing Erlang on OSX</h3>

<p>This is incredibly easy with <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">Homebrew</a> (a package manager for OSX). As simple as:</p>

<pre><code>brew install erlang</code></pre>

<p>I expect they&#8217;ll be some cases where I need more than that stock install, but it&#8217;s good enough to get started. I haven&#8217;t tried it on my server, but it looks like a simple apt-get should do the trick, rather than the ball-ache of compiling from source.</p>

<h3>Writing &#8216;Hello World&#8217;</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.erlang.org/faq/getting_started.html#id52506">Erlang FAQ</a> has the simplest example:</p>

<code><pre>
-module(hello).
-export([hello_world/0]).

hello_world() -&gt; io:fwrite("hello, world\n").
</pre></code>

<p>Save that as <code>hello.erl</code> (the name of the file needs to match the module name), run the Erlang shell (run <code>erl</code>) and compile it like so:</p>

<code><pre>
$ erl
1 &gt; c(hello).
</pre></code>

<p>This will generate an Erlang bytcode file called <code>hello.beam</code> in your working directory. To run it, switch back to the Erlang shell and call the exported function on your module.</p>

<code><pre>
2 &gt; hello:hello_world().
hello, world
ok
3 &gt; 
</pre></code>

<p>Simple. Thought i&#8217;d also recommend looking at a <a href="http://egarson.blogspot.com/2008/03/real-erlang-hello-world.html">more complicated &#8216;Hello World&#8217;</a> that is a more idiomatic and Erlang-y version, </p>

<h3>What next?</h3>

<p>I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dsingleton/status/22716268050124801">asked on Twitter</a> for some good Erlang resources, books, blogs, tutorials etc:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/193435600X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpdsingleco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=193435600X">Joe Armstrong - Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World</a>. A lot of very smart people recommend this, the classic book on Erlang by one of it&#8217;s creators. It&#8217;s going on my Kindle as I type.</li>
<li><a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/">learn you some Erlang</a>. A more approachable introduction to Erlang, with a little of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">_why&#8217;s</a> style about it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.delicious.com/dsingleton/erlang">My bookmarks tagged Erlang</a>. I&#8217;ll be adding more links as I collect them.</li>
</ul><p>I guess my next step is to pick a small project to building in Erlang. It always seems better to have a simple project to help pick up a language.</p>

<p>At the moment I think i&#8217;m going to work through some of the <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler&gt;</a> problems and get to grips with the basics. Then perhaps build a toy web server, which has the added bonus of grokking more of the HTTP spec.</p>

<h3>And finallyâ€¦</h3>

<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be a beginning Erlang blog post without the obligatory &#8220;<em>Hello Joe</em>" from the brilliant Erlang: The Movie</p>
