<p><strong>Note:</strong> We actually did this a few months ago now – But I lost the ‘making of’ pictures and only found them again recently.</p>
<p>We’ve already got <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/456997932/">some art</a> up on the walls in our dev room at <a href="http://springdigital.co.uk/">work</a>, but two walls were boring and mostly white.</p>
<p>I decided to take some inspiration from one of my old Uni house-mates, <strong>Mark</strong>, who happens to be a great pixel-artist.</p>

<p>A while back Mark got bored and made <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/29120030/?qo=22&amp;q=by%3Ablackice&amp;qh=boost%3Apopular+-in%3Ascraps">something very neat</a> out of a lot of coloured paper and geekyness. “This will look awesome on a big wall” we all agreed.</p>
<p><em>So we got started…</em></p>

<h3>Time for an Art-Attack</h3>
<p>Follow closely and you can recreate your own life size <strong>Pixel Art Space Invaders</strong> at home!</p>
<p>We got a rainbow pack of 3×3” sheets – from staples, or Rymans, or some stationary shop – for a pound or two</p>

<p><a title="Step 1: Get Coloured Paper" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/471778655/"><img alt="Step 1: Get Coloured Paper" class="content" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/172/471778655_cac75d3b80_m.jpg" height="180" width="240"/></a></p>
<p>We cut down the largish squares of paper in to quarters with a scalpel/metal ruler.</p>
<p>Then mocked up a ship on the desk.</p>
<p><a title="Step 2: Cut and plan your Invaders" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/471759908/"><img alt="Step 2: Cut and plan your Invaders" class="content" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/216/471759908_115a6b1221_m.jpg" height="240" width="180"/></a></p>
<p>We used copious amounts of blu-tac. You might want to use white-tac as the blue showed through a little bit on the lighter colours.</p>
<p>You also want 3 or 4 people standing and watching whoever is putting the squares up to constantly tell them “<em>It’s not quite straight!</em>“</p>
<p><a title="Step 3: Attach to wall" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/471759476/"><img alt="Step 3: Attach to wall" class="content" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/225/471759476_12427e48d7_m.jpg" height="183" width="240"/></a></p>
<p>This one was a bit difficult to make as the scale version compared to the normal ships is quite a lot bigger – which looked weird on the wall – so we had to shrink it down a bit.</p>
<p><a title="Step 4: Build the bonus ship" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/471776971/"><img alt="Step 4: Build the bonus ship" class="content" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/171/471776971_41918214a0_m.jpg" height="180" width="240"/></a></p>
<p>Extra points for the mother ship – shoot where it’s <em>going</em> to be.</p>

<p><a title="Step 5: Place bonus ship just out of reach" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/471757992/"><img alt="Step 5: Place bonus ship just out of reach" class="content" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/216/471757992_fc0cbe56d5_m.jpg" height="180" width="240"/></a></p>
<p>The final result. Not bad considering it was all done rather spontaneously over lunch one day.<br/><a title="Step 6: Admire your handy-work" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/471756942/"><img alt="Step 6: Admire your handy-work" class="content" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/167/471756942_ea2e13d9ca_m.jpg" height="181" width="240"/></a></p>
<h3>More Pixels and Space Invaders</h3>
<p>There’s been loads of other great pixel/paper art, most of which blows what we did out of the water, but these ones are absolutely amazing and definately deserve a look if you haven’t seen them before.</p>
