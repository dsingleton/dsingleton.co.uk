<p>A week later I still haven&#8217;t written up my SF trip and as a friend asked for tips here&#8217;s a micro version!</p>

<blockquote><cite> - <a href="http://twitter.com/carlgaywood/status/3425639734">@carlgaywood</a></cite> @dsingleton any tips for San Francisco?</blockquote>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>;These are mostly based in/around mission as that&#8217;s where I stayed.</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://playfoursquare.com/venue/22250">Papalote</a> - Good mexican</li>
<li><a href="http://playfoursquare.com/venue/11965">Thirsty Bear Brewing Company</a> - Local brewery, get the beer sampler</li>
<li><a href="http://playfoursquare.com/venue/19179">Ritual Coffee Roasters</a> - Amazing coffee</li>
<li><a href="http://playfoursquare.com/venue/11833">Dolores Park</a> - Nice to sit in if sunny, amazing views</li>
<li><a href="http://playfoursquare.com/venue/34970">Birite creamery</a> - amazing ice cream shop just near Delores Park</li>
<li><a href="http://playfoursquare.com/venue/39848">Four Barrel Coffee</a> - more excellent coffee</li>
</ul><p>Also trying walking around Delores/Guerrero St area, nice shops including the <a href="http://www.826valencia.org/">pirate store
</a>, fun area to explore too.</p>

<p>Get an old fashioned tram to the ferry building, hire a bike a cycle across the golden gate bridge, get the ferry back. Have dinner in down town</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t make this one, but get a bus to the top of twin peaks and look at the amazing all across SF. </p>

<p>Also, here are my photos from the trip;</p>
