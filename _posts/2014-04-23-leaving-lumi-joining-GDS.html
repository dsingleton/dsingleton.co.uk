<p>Anyone following my life by the continuity of this blog alone may be confused by this title.</p>

<h3>Lumi</h3>
<p>It's 2 &amp; half years since <a href="/blog/leaving-last-fm/">my last proper udpate</a>. Coincidentally that's when I left Last.fm and joined <a href="https://lumi.do">Lumi</a> as one of the founding team.</p>

<p>Diving into a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/04/last-fm-founders-next-track-lumi-a-site-that-uses-your-browsing-history-to-help-you-discover-things-on-the-web/">brand new startup</a> is a hugely time consuming experience, it didn't leave a lot of time for writing.</p>

<p>That said, it's something I wish I'd written more about it at the time. It was an amazing experience and hopefully I'll find the time to write about in the future.</p>

<h3>GDS</h3>
<p>The <em>recent</em> news, is that I've joined <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">GDS</a> &mdash; the Government Digital Service</p>

<p>It's a team &ndash; almost a startup &ndash; within Goverment that is <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/">tasked</a> with leading the digital transformation of Government.</p>

<p>A totally audacious project. From a tiny team building prototypes, to hundreds of people and projects all across government. Most importantly, it's changing the way government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">builds digital services</a> and even the way government itself works.</p>

<p>I've been following their work, the team, and I've been more impressed by both for a long time.</p>

<p>I'm really excited to be joining the team, to see what I can help them achieve and what I can learn from some world class people.</p>
