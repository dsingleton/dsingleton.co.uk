<p>8 years of scrobbling, 55,000 tracks and 4 years with the incredible <a href="http://www.last.fm/about/team">Last.fm team</a>, it&#8217;s been a blast, but it&#8217;s time to move on and do something new.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lastfm/4879733664/" title="Brand Ambassadors 06 by Last.fm, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4879733664_d6e4b17389.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="Brand Ambassadors 06"/></a>

<p>It&#8217;s been a really difficult decision to leave. Last.fm was quite literally a dream job for me and at times a family. I&#8217;m proud to have worked on a brilliant product with so many great people. I feel like i&#8217;ve grown up with Last.fm. It&#8217;s been, and will always be, a big and very happy part of my life.</p>

<p>I really can&#8217;t describe how much I&#8217;ve learnt and how much fun i&#8217;ve had, but some of highlights include the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/2175975083/">ballpit</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/4669213869/">roof BBQs</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/4417983904/">Nerf wars</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/2224410166/in/set-72157603403049536">big releases</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/1767603000/in/set-72157603403049536">office music</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/4112671768/">stats</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/4112671768/">challenges</a>, but that&#8217;s still just a tiny fraction. </p>

<p><b>What next?</b> Well, a long, and probably wet, weekend camping in Wales. Chilling out a bit and relaxing. </p>
