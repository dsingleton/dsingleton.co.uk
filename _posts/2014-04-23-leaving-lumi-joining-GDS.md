Anyone following my life by the continuity of this blog alone may be confused by this title.

### Lumi

It's 2 & half years since [my last proper udpate](/blog/leaving-last-fm/). Coincidentally that's when I left Last.fm and joined [Lumi](https://lumi.do) as one of the founding team.

Diving into a [brand new startup](http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/04/last-fm-founders-next-track-lumi-a-site-that-uses-your-browsing-history-to-help-you-discover-things-on-the-web/) is a hugely time consuming experience, it didn't leave a lot of time for writing.

That said, it's something I wish I'd written more about it at the time. It was an amazing experience and hopefully I'll find the time to write about in the future.

### GDS

The _recent_ news, is that I've joined [GDS](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/) — the Government Digital Service

It's a team – almost a startup – within Goverment that is [tasked](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/) with leading the digital transformation of Government.

A totally audacious project. From a tiny team building prototypes, to hundreds of people and projects all across government. Most importantly, it's changing the way government [builds digital services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and even the way government itself works.

I've been following their work, the team, and I've been more impressed by both for a long time.

I'm really excited to be joining the team, to see what I can help them achieve and what I can learn from some world class people.
