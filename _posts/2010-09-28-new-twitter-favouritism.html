<p>Twitter have been slowly rolling out access to it&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/newtwitter">new web interface </a>, to much discussion, arguing and complaining - not to mention recent security issues.</p>

<p>Putting all that to one side the feature of #newtwitter I&#8217;m really fond of is showing your most recently favourited tweet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/5033691595/" title="New Twitter by David Singleton, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/5033691595_8feda74af3.jpg" width="462" height="242" alt="New Twitter"/></a></p>

<p>Favouriting is an underrated feature on Twitter, though it&#8217;s slightly at odds with the concept of a Retweet and requires the use of <a href="http://favstar.fm">external tools</a> to get the most out of it. It&#8217;s not surprising it&#8217;s used so infrequently.</p>

<p>Displaying your most recent favourite, gives you an incentive to favourite more. Primarily it reminds you the feature exists and that you&#8217;ve used it. The temporal nature of a tweet also reminds you of the time since you last favourited something. That&#8217;s good motivation to favourite something new</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a minor detail amongst a massive UI overhaul, but I think it&#8217;s a clever and subtle way to encourage more use of the feature.</p>
