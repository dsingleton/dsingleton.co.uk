<p>Over christmas I sorted out some old boxes from University and found all the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/tags/tickets/">paper ticket stubs</a> for gigs from 2002 to 2005. That&#8217;s some meaty data I didn&#8217;t want to lose, I copied it to a spreadsheet with plans to import it in to the <a href="http://last.fm/user/underpangs/events/">Last.fm events system</a> (where I track all my current gig habbits). </p>

<p>Unfortunately the <a href="http://last.fm/events/add">add events workflow</a> is a real pain for adding more than one event at once, let alone the 50 I had. In the future we hope to add better support for adding multiple events, either with a new tool (aimed at promoters) or creating an <i>event.add</i> <a href="http://last.fm/api">API method</a> (and let someone else build it), but in the meantime I wanted a quick hack solution to speed things up.</p>

<p>Seeing as I had all my data in CSV already, the simplest approach is to generate URLs that pre-fill the &#8220;Add Event&#8221; form data and let you skip to the last step. <strong>Note;</strong> We use one-time form tokens to prevent XSRF attacks, so you can&#8217;t just submit the form a script. All the fields can be passed as GET variables to prefill, here are the query param names you&#8217;ll need to do this:</p>

<dl><dt>type</dt>
    <dd>"gig" or "festival"</dd>
    
    <dt>startday</dt>
    <dd>2 digit day, eg <em>03</em></dd>
    
    <dt>startmonth</dt>
    <dd>2 digit month, eg <em>11</em></dd>
    
    <dt>startyear</dt>
    <dd>4 digit year, eg <em>2002</em></dd>
    
    <dt>starttime</dt>
    <dd>24 hour time separated by a colon, eg <em>20:00</em></dd>
    
    <dt>venueid</dt>
    <dd>The Last.fm venue id, you can find this in the venue URL</dd>
    
    <dt>festivalName</dt>
    <dd>Confusingly this is just event name/title, not festival specific</dd>
    
    <dt>artistNames</dt>
    <dd>Multiple artist names, specified as an array, eg artistNames[]=Blur&amp;artistNames[]=Radiohead&amp;artistNames[]=Pulp</dd>
</dl><p>So a complete example looks like:</p>
<p><code><a href="http://last.fm/events/add?type=gig&amp;artistNames">http://last.fm/events/add?type=gig&amp;artistNames</a>[]=Sparta&amp;startday=04&amp;startmonth=10&amp;startyear=2005&amp;starttime=20:00&amp;venueid=8777858&amp;festivalName=</code></p>

<p>If you have your events in a structured format then it&#8217;s easy to build a quick script to generate these links and really reduce the time needed to add events. Far far from ideal I know (and I&#8217;m a bit embarrassed to post it) but it might save you some time. I promise to build event.add to the API soon.</p>
