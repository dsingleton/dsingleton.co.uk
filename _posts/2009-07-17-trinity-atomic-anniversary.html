<p>64 years ago, on July 16, 1945 Trinity was the first test of an atomic weapon. It&#8217;s no hyperbole to say that it changed the world we live in forever. This isn&#8217;t the kind of thing i&#8217;d usually write about, but it&#8217;s an important subject, and the quote from Oppenheimer is very moving (particularly the video).</p>

<blockquote>We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, <strong>"Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."</strong> I suppose we all thought that one way or another.</blockquote>

<p>On a slightly happier note, i&#8217;d recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041">Surely You&#8217;re Joking Mr Feynman</a> by Richard Feyman. He worked on the trinity project, amongst other things and was a brilliant man. He was also a real character and has some very entertaining tales and an excellent read.</p>
