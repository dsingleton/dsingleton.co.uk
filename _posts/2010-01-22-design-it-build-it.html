<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce i&#8217;ll be speaking at <a href="http://www.dibiconference.com/">Design it, Build it</a> - A one day web conference on April 28th in Newcastle. It&#8217;s aimed at both designs &amp; developers with a separate track of talks for each</p>

<p>I consider myself a jack-of-all-trades most of the time, with my time (and passion) split evenly between frontend and backend. So it&#8217;s great to see a conference with such a great mix of topics, definately the kind of thing i&#8217;d be attending anyway if I wasn&#8217;t speaking.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really pleased to have been invited to speak and even though it&#8217;s still a few months away I&#8217;m already getting excited. My topic is &#8220;<em>Last.fm Vs Xbox360</em>&#8221;, a look at profiling, optimizing, scaling and launching new features, using the recent Last.fm Xbox Live app as a working example. I&#8217;m a big fan of presentations that include a healthy dose practical examples, I&#8217;ve got a &#8220;Tales from the trenches&#8221; style in mind. </p>

<p>Today&#8217;s the last day to get a discounted early-bird ticket. If you want to <a href="http://www.amiando.com/dibi.html">buy a ticket</a> you can save ~60% by using the code &#8220;<em>dibi_hohoho</em>&#8221;, but only till the end of the day. I believe they&#8217;ve still got some Student tickets available at a reduced rate, get in touch if you&#8217;re interested in those.</p>
